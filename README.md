# docker-engine-install
### Introduction
This script is for installing Docker Engine in Windows Computers, without requiring Docker Desktop, as Docker Desktop requires license for most of the commercial use-cases (Ref: https://www.docker.com/pricing/) 

### Reason for this script
 - In spite of many articles out there on how to get the Docker Engine installed, I hardly found comprehensive list of steps in one place. 
 - All the writeups assumed that we would be working in accounts having Administrator access. Typically in corporate setup, you would be working on Standard User access, while only installations happen at Administrator level. So, it is very important to describe the necessary steps to have Standard Users also access to Docker Engine and hence I created this script.
 - One click Installation - I have not found a comprehensive script for accomplishing all the required steps, even though many of the articles tried to list down the steps. I thought one click installable script, would make life easier for all of us.


### Pre-requisites

 1. PowerShell Core - https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell 
 2. Administrator User access, when executing this script
 
 ### Legal Stuff
 I just put what I thought would work for me. This is no way an assurance that it would work for you. You are solely responsible for any and all damages that my incur when you use it. Basically, it all your responsibility. Understand the steps and execute them cautiously.

All the best!
